A testing ground for various and random interesting (mostly) things.

I like making stuff and exploring the power of coding. I hope to merge my love of music and coding to create something new and wonderful.

I'm from Vermont and hold maple syrup to high standards. Currently living in Austin, TX but always have some VT syrup in the refrigerator.
